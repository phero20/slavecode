# React Hooks: Mutations

The `mutations/` directory abstracts all state-mutating API calls using `useMutation` from React Query (@tanstack/react-query). 

By isolating mutations in these hooks, the components remain clean and only have to call `mutate({ data })` without worrying about HTTP clients or cache invalidation logic.

## Files
