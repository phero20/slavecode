## 💻 Platform Features

SlaveCode is more than just a code submission site — it is a complete competitive programmer's and software engineer's ecosystem. Here is every feature available from the platform navigation, in order:

---

### 🎓 Academy — [slavecode.codes/academy/tracks](https://slavecode.codes/academy/tracks)
Master programming languages through structured, exercise-driven learning tracks. The Academy hosts **82+ language tracks** spanning everything from beginner-friendly Gleam, Go, and Haskell to advanced functional and compiled languages. Each track is tagged by paradigm (Compiled, Functional, Declarative, Imperative, etc.) and contains hundreds of progressive exercises. Every language has a properly structured track roadmap with detailed concepts and exercises — from "Hello World" to advanced algorithm implementations.

---

### 🗺️ DSA Roadmap — [slavecode.codes/roadmap](https://slavecode.codes/roadmap)
Stop guessing what to learn next in competitive programming. The interactive DSA Roadmap guides you through every concept of Data Structures and Algorithms in a highly structured, logical sequence. Navigate through clearly defined subtopics from basic Arrays to complex Trees and Tries, with each topic paired with targeted practice problems. Track your true mastery as you conquer every node on the path — from basics through Booleans, Strings, If-Else Statements, to Numbers and beyond.

---

### 💻 Problems — [slavecode.codes/problems](https://slavecode.codes/problems)
A curated bank of algorithmic and language-specific problems ranging from introductory exercises to advanced competitive programming challenges. Each problem is paired with hidden test cases evaluated by Judge0 sandboxes, with automatic AI judging fallbacks for edge cases. Track your solutions, language performance, and solution votes. Problems are filterable by difficulty, category, company, and programming language.

---

### ⚔️ Arena — [slavecode.codes/arena](https://slavecode.codes/arena)
The multiplayer competitive battleground. **Host or join a coding match** in real time — select problems from the extensive catalog to host a custom coding match, or enter a pin code to join an active match. Compete against up to 50 challengers simultaneously with a live leaderboard. Arena Points and global rankings are awarded based on your final rank and execution speed. The real-time match state is powered by a dedicated Golang WebSocket server using Redis Pub/Sub for instant leaderboard broadcasting.
